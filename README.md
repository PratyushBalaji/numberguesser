# numberguesser

Instructions on how to run :

Install python (Latest version as of today is recommended but the code is simple enough to work with any version I think)
Latest release as of publishing : 3.9.6

Install this code by either getting the zip file from github and unzipping it or getting the link and typing "git clone <link>"

Open it by double clicking or if you want to overcomplicate things, 

1) Open command prompt.

2) Change directory till you reach the folder this code is installed in

3) Type in this code :
py numberGuesser.py

It should open :)
